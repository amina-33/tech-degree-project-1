                <h2>Profile</h2>
                <p>Throughout my career I have gained experience in quantitative and qualitative research and data analysis from working in a research laboratory to working with clients in consulting. I am currently the Head of Secondary school at Brook Hill International School in Belgrade, Serbia. In my role as head, I focus on innovation projects, client relationship management and school strategy. Prior to my role here, I was the director of my own company, AMC Consulting and Training in Belgrade. I advised multi-national clients from the Life Sciences sector on ways to use data and technology to improve understanding of diseases and patient care. Prior to AMC Consulting, I worked for the healthcare company, IQVIA, as a consultant, in the Real-World Insights department. Before joining IQVIA, I was a consultant at Deloitte within the Finance Consulting practice, where I worked with FTSE 100 clients and specialised in large scale Finance transformation projects that involved process, organisation and data design.</p>
                <p>I have a PhD in biochemistry from University College London, during which time I worked in a Cancer Research UK laboratory for four years and published my results in the scientific journal Nature. I have also completed a BSc Hons in Biomedical Science where I graduated top of my class. I have experience of living in several different countries and cultures. I am half British, half Lebanese and bilingual in English and Arabic. I also speak fluent Serbian and French.</p>
