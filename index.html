        <p>I am half Scottish and half Lebanese and I have lived in several countries. I am currently living in Belgrade,
          Serbia where I work as the Head of Secondary at a British international school.</p>
        <p>I haven't always worked in education, my background is in biochemistry and I previously worked in consulting,
          mainly for healthcare and pharmaceuticals. </p>
        <p>I've always been interested in tech and have dipped in and out of various projects throughout my career. This
          however, is the first time I'm learning to code!</p>

        <h2 class=front-h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I started this course because I want to combine my love of design and tech. My main goal for the project is to be able to build a user-friendly beautiful looking website.</p>
        <p>To achieve that, I will need to become skilled at coding:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>Java script</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'd like to use these new skills in the med-tech industry, since my background is in science and medicine (see <a class=in-text-link href="CV.html">Curriculum Vitae</a> for more information)
        </p>
